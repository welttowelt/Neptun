# Neptun

Yo frens, welcome to Neptun! ðŸŒŠ

Neptun is your go-to DApp for some sick DeFi action. We got a Rust backend handling all the biz logic and API endpoints, and Solidity smart contracts running the token and DeFi magic on the blockchain. All this is powered by Foundry for smooth deployment and testing.

## What's in the Box?
- **Rust Backend:** Fast, secure, and handling all the heavy lifting.
- **Solidity Smart Contracts:** Running on the blockchain like a boss.
- **Foundry:** Making sure everything gets deployed and tested seamlessly.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the repo and jump into the project directory.
2. Set up the Rust backend with all the deps.
3. Create and deploy the Solidity smart contracts with Foundry.
4. Hook up the Rust and Solidity parts to get the full DApp experience.
